# Fake or Real News Classifier

## Overview
This project uses NLP and scikit-learn to classify news articles as fake or real. It showcases data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Features
- Clean and vectorize text (tokenization, TF-IDF)
- Train classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes
- Evaluate: Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Predict on new samples using trained model

## Tech Stack
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, NLTK/ spaCy
- (Optional) matplotlib or seaborn for visualization

## Follow the Workflow
1. Open `Fake_or_Real_News.ipynb`
2. Execute cells step-by-step to preprocess, train, and evaluate model
3. Make predictions on sample news text

## Possible Next Steps
- Create modular Python scripts
- Add performance visualizations
- Upgrade with transformer-based NLP models
- Deploy as a web demo with Flask or Streamlit
